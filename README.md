# Health-Insurance-Charges

This project explores the factors influencing individual treatment costs and builds predictive models for the charges by health insurance using the R programming environment. The insights derived from this work can help insurance companies and policy planners to set more accurate premiums and design targeted interventions. 

**â€»** It was conducted collaboratively with my partner, Kelly Lee.  

### Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Analyze a real-world dataset to identify key variables influencing healthcare costs.
- **Model Development:** Utilize regression techniques to predict insurance charges and determine the best fit of various models.
- **Insight Extraction:** Interpret the model results to understand the relative importance of features, finding significant predictors of higher costs.
- **Data Storytelling:** Present the findings through visualizations and clear code snippets to facilitate further exploration and adaptation by others.

## Methodology and Tools

- **Libraries**: lmtest, readr, ggplot2, faraway, lattice, caret, knitr, car, glmnet
- **Computational Language**: R
